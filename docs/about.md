# About GraphBit

GraphBit is a **proprietary, production-grade LLM framework** engineered for real-world, agentic AI orchestration. Designed to outperform and outlast prototypes, and is built to excel under the unforgiving demands of enterprise deployment.

Many frameworks in this space target research or prototyping and can struggle under real-world complexity — agents may freeze under load, silent failures can go undetected, and debugging becomes difficult. GraphBit was created to bridge this **proof-of-concept to production gap**, providing a resilient execution layer designed for concurrency, observability, and enterprise-grade reliability so systems remain stable under pressure and operate continuously.

## Built by InfinitiBit GmbH

GraphBit is developed by **InfinitiBit GmbH**, a Munich-based technology company founded in **2023**. With over 15 years of expertise in PLM, ALM, process mining, and enterprise transformation, InfinitiBit combines deep enterprise experience with cutting-edge AI innovation.  
The team combines experience from advanced AI research and engineering environments, combining academic rigor with practical, high-stakes deployment. InfinitiBit’s mission is to provide resilient infrastructure for the age of agentic AI, helping enterprises move beyond fragile demos and into reliable, production-grade systems.

## Why GraphBit Stands Out

Independent benchmarks show GraphBit achieving the **lowest CPU usage (0.000–0.352%) and near-zero memory consumption (<0.15 MB)** across all evaluated frameworks, while maintaining **100% stability** under load. It excels in resource-constrained environments such as **edge computing, embedded systems, and serverless deployments**.  
Though trade-offs exist in extremely complex workflows, GraphBit’s efficiency and stability make it a natural choice for organizations where reliability and cost-efficiency matter most.
GraphBit is in active enterprise use across Germany with limited opportunities for co-innovation and strategic partnerships.

## Who It’s For

GraphBit is designed for **enterprises, research institutions, and AI teams** that are pushing beyond prototypes into production. It supports organizations building sophisticated multi-agent systems, research groups running complex workflows, and platform teams in need of reliable, scalable pipelines. Wherever AI systems must operate reliably under real-world pressure with consistency and resilience, GraphBit aims to provide a stable foundation.
